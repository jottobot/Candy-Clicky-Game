# Candy Clicky Game

## Overview

Candy Clicky Game is a memory game created with React. Each of the application's UI is split into components with live response to user events.

## How to play

The application renders images to the screen, specifically vintage candy brands. The user's score is incremented when clicking on a candy for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same candy more than once.

When a candy is clicked, the candy images rendered to the page are shuffled in a random order making the user use their memory to ensure an incorrect guess isn't made.

The goal is to reach the highest score with out an incorrect guess.
